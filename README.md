Raygun4WP
==========

[Raygun](http://raygun.com) provider plugin for Wordpress

Wordpress plugin providing the easy integration of Raygun to Wordpress websites. [Crash reporting](https://raygun.com/products/crash-reporting) allows developers to easily track errors, exceptions and crashes automatically while pulse provides you with [real user monitoring](https://raygun.com/products/real-user-monitoring).

This provider uses the lower-level [Raygun4PHP](https://github.com/MindscapeHQ/raygun4php) provider for server-side crash reporting and [Raygun4JS](https://github.com/MindscapeHQ/raygun4js) for both client-side crash reporting and real user monitoring.

**Multisite support**: This plugin supports Multisite installations, but a specific installation procedure should be followed. Read the instructions below for more information.

## Installation

Ensure that your server is running
- PHP 5.3.3 or newer
- **curl** library enabled

### Manually with Git

Clone this repository into your Wordpress installation's `/plugins` folder - e.g. `/wordpress/wp-content/plugins`. Use the --recursive flag to also pull down the [Raygun4PHP](https://github.com/MindscapeHQ/raygun4php) and [Raygun4JS](https://github.com/MindscapeHQ/raygun4js) dependencies:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/MindscapeHQ/raygun4wordpress.git
```

### From Wordpress Plugin Directory

Add it from the official repository using your admin panel - the plugin is available on [wordpress.org/plugins/raygun4wp/](http://wordpress.org/plugins/raygun4wp/).

## Usage

1. Navigate to your Wordpress admin panel, click on Plugins, and then **Activate Raygun4WP**
2. Go to the Raygun4WP settings panel either by the sidebar or admin notification
3. Copy your application's API key from the [Raygun dashboard](https://app.raygun.com/dashboard/) and place it in the API key field
4. Enable `Error Tracking` (both server-side and client-side), `Real User Monitoring` and any other options
5. Save your changes
6. Done!

## Pulse - Real User Monitoring

As of 1.8 of Raygun4WP plugin you can enable [real user monitoring](https://raygun.com/products/real-user-monitoring).

This feature can be enabled via the Settings page under **Pulse - Real User Monitoring**.

User information will be sent along if you have the unique user tracking feature enabled.

## Client-side error tracking

Since 1.4 of the Raygun4WP plugin you can enable client-side error monitoring.

This feature automatically tracks JavaScript errors that occur in your user's browsers when they are loaded.

This setting can be activated via the Settings page.

## Customer Experience Monitoring

This feature can be enabled via the Settings page.

Enabling this feature will send through the currently logged in user's email address, first name and last name with each message to Raygun. This applies to both Crash Reporting and Pulse payloads.

If a user is not logged in, no user data will be sent and a random ID will be assigned to the user.

The user's information will then be available to you when viewing crash reports and user sessions. If the user has an associated Gravatar with that address, you will see their picture.

If this feature is not enabled, a random ID will be assigned to each user.

## Tagging errors

Since 1.8 both client-side and server-side errors can be tagged. Tags are custom test allowing you to easily identify errors.

JavaScript and PHP errors can be tagged independently through a comma-delimited list in the field on the settings page.

For example: `Error, JavaScript` would add two tags. The first being `Error` second one being `JavaScript`

## Ignored domains

You can enter a comma-delimited list in the field on the settings page to prevent certain domains from sending errors and from being tracked with real user monitoring.

## Async sending

Introduced in 1.1.3, this provider will now send asynchronously on *nix servers (async sockets) resulting in a massive speedup - POSTing to Raygun now takes ~56ms including SSL handshakes. This behaviour can be disabled in code if desired to fall back to blocking socket sends. Async sending is also unavailable on Windows due to a bug in PHP 5.3, and as a result it uses cURL processes. This can be disabled if your server is running a newer environment; please create an issue if you'd like help with this.

As of 1.9.0, you can now toggle asynchronous sending through the Raygun settings page in the admin dashboard.
