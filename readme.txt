Simple add and enable this plugin, paste in your Raygun API Key (available when you create a new application in your Raygun.io dashboard) and you're done.

== Frequently Asked Questions  ==

= What does my Wordpress site require to use this plugin?  =

This plugin automates the installation of Raygun4php, the PHP 5 provider for Raygun. As a result it requires the dependencies that Raygun4php needs.

Specifically, the server that your Wordpress site runs on requires a **PHP 5.3** environment with the **curl** library and dependencies. Please ask your administrator if this is not enabled (as shown with phpinfo()).

When activating the plugin, if you receive a PHP error message stating that there is an 'Unexpected T_STRING', you may be running a PHP 5.2 or below installation. Raygun4WP currently only supports PHP 5.3, a version compatible with 5.2 may be available - please contact us through raygun.io if you require this.

= How do I use the unique user tracking feature? =

If you enable this feature the currently logged in user's email address will be transmitted along with each message. This will be visible in the Raygun dashboard. If they have associated a Gravatar with that address, you will see their picture. If this feature is not enabled, a random ID will be assigned to each user. Either way, you can view a count of the affected users for each error.
